# Personal-Portfolio

## I Created a personal portolio using HTML and CSS elements.

## I wanted to be sure to use multiple different style methods such as flexbox, hover properties, and clickable links

### one of the biggest challenges i had was flexbox and positioning

### I wanted to try to use variables as much as possible even though i only swapped between 2, a light and dark theme. however the variables did make it easier to keep track of what had which element rather than looking at the color i could just see "light" or "dark"

### I do hope with more work added in place of the current placeholders, the page will grow bigger thus showing off the "scroll when click" mechanic i put into the hrefs

### There was some challenges pushing a correct html file but after renaming to index.html isntead of index.HTML it deploys fine
